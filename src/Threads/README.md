## The Idea
We have a company whose profit is to make as much money as possible.</br> 
The company contains bunch of workers and a boss controlling them.
All the workers need to work together to calculate taxes as fast as possible for the company.
</br>
## General work plan
* Design the interfaces of each class.</br>
* Create an unending or very big problem for the workers to work on.</br>
* Manage to involve the boss to control the workers so that things may change when they're working so think become more complex.</br>
